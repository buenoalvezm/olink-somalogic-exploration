# Proteomics multi-platform analyses

Exploring Olink Explore HT & SomaScan 11K plasma proteomics data

## 📊 Overview

This repository contains exploratory analyses of large-scale plasma proteomics data from Olink Explore HT and SomaScan 11K. Main analyses include:

- **Cohort characterization** – sample distributions, demographics, and proteome-wide patterns
- **Technology comparison** – mapping and evaluation of overlapping proteins
- **Sources of variance** – ANOVA models assessing the effects of age, sex, BMI, and disease
- **Machine learning** – classification of diseases, and age prediction

## 🩺 Disease-specific marker pipeline

Pipeline to identify and compare disease-associated proteins across both technologies. Comparisons performed against:
- Healthy controls
- Related diseases
- All other diseases (pan-disease background)
